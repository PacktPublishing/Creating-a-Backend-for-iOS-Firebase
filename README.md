## About the Video Course
Most iPhone apps connect to some sort of backend, whether it is a video game that has game servers, a social network that keeps users connected, or an inventory system for a business. In this course, you will learn how to create a backend system for your iOS apps using Firebase.

We'll begin first by learning about CocoaPods. CocoaPods allow us to bring other people's code into our project. We will need this in order to get Firebase code into our project. Then we will start the course project: creating a simple version of SnapChat. Doing this will allow us to learn the ins and outs of Firebase.

After installing Firebase, you'll move on to learn how to build our social network one step at a time. First, you'll master user account creation and user authentication. Then you'll create snaps to send to other users. Throughout all this, you'll learn about Firebase's database, storage, and authentication system.
